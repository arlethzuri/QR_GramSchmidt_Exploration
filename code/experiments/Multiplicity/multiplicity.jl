Noise on a Nice Diagonal Matrix

In this experiment, I want to see how the QR algorithm performs on a diagonal matrix that progressively has
more noise added to it. By noise, I mean going from a nice diagonal matrix where all entries are 0 except the diagonal
to a diagonal matrix that has noise added to the entire matrix as demonstrated below.

A plot showing iteration count by noise addition to matrix is generated.
